void

spread operator : we can use this on array, string and object. when spread parameter is used as parameter to the function it is known as reast parameter

Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.

hoisting
This is because the JavaScript interpreter splits the declaration and assignment of functions and variables: it "hoists" your declarations to the top of their containing scope before execution.

variable hoisting:
Variables declared with let and const are hoisted but not initialized with a default value.

js is single threaded language
refers to a language where only one set of instructions or operations can be executed at a time within a program.js typically operates within a single main thread, known as the "UI thread" or "main thread.mitigate this issue, techniques such as "asynchronous programming" and web workers are employed in JavaScript to delegate time-consuming tasks to separate threads or handle them asynchronously without blocking the main thread.

hoisting also happens with var variables. var variables are initialized as undefined.

function decleration    function doStuff() {};
function expression   const doStuff = function() {} 
const doStuff = () => {} functions in ES6 // arrow functions are also known as function expressions.
function declarations
function expressions : function expressions are used to avoide global scope
IEEE - immediately invoked function expressions. here functions are created at the same time tyey're called.
(function() => {})()   or    (() => {})()
