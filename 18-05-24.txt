Restful API's using express

const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer(( req, res) => {
    if(req.url = '/'){
        // ...
    }
    if(req.url === api/cources){
        //.....
    }
});
server.listen(3000);
here we can't write multiple if else statements for complex applications. so Express is used for building lightweight applications.

Express : express is a minimal and flexible web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications.
HTTP methods of express 
get
post
put
delete

app.get('/', (req, res) => {  // this is more simple method with express
    res.send('Hello');
});
app.get('/cources', (req, res) => {
    res.send([1,2,3,4]);
});
app.listen(3000,() => console.log("Listening the port 3000"));


nodemon = node monitor
nodemon index.js // for running the application

PORT envirement variable
process.env.PORT

set is used to set value of some envirement variable
set PORT = 4000


app.get('cources/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.send({ id: 1, courceName:"first cource"});
})

req.params
req.query

query parameters:
Query parameters are the components of a URL that come after the "?" symbol and are used to pass specific information to the server. In the context of web development with frameworks like Express.js, query parameters are commonly accessed to extract information from incoming HTTP requests.
